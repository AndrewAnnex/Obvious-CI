Obvious-CI
==========

Obvious-CI is not a continuous integration tool in itself, but can be used
to simplify the implementation of continuous integration using free tools
such as Travis CI and appveyor.

Obvious-CI aims to simplify the CI setup of a repository by providing
infrastructural setup scripts so that your repository can focus on the
continuous integration actions and outputs rather than on the repetitive
setup of the environment itself.
